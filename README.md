## Introduction

Welcome to my repo for the Makers Academy weekday challenge(2). My task was to create a program that satisfied the requirements below.

## Useage

## Step x Step

In order to be successful at this project, my code needed to satisfy the following specification:

- [x] Each card has a default balance pre-loaded.
- [x] The user is able to add a customisable amount of money to their card.
- [x] The top-up limit is capped (so users can limit the amount that is loaded onto the card).
- [x] Fares are calculated and deducted from the card balance.
- [x] The user can touch in and touch out when necessary.
- [x] There is a minimum charge for a single journey.
- [x] The balance is deducted when the journey is COMPLETE (and not before!)
- [ ] The user can see where they have travelled from.
- [ ] The user can access their journey history.
- [ ] The user can find out the London "zone" of their desired destination.
- [ ] A penalty charge is deducted if the user fails to touch in or touch out correctly.
